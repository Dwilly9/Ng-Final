# Ng Final

This Angular project was my submitted as my final project for the Web Development course I took at Seton Hill University in the Spring of 2020 with Professor Greg Barry.

This project allows a user to create a baseball player by entering a player name, and then calculating popular baseball statistics for that player aftwards.
This project is the culmination of about half of a semester of studying Angular, and therefore showcases many core concepts of the framework at work.
