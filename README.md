# Ng Final
This was my final project for my Web Development class at Seton Hill University with Professor Greg Barry taken in the Spring of 2020.

This project is written in the AngularJS framework and is the culmination of mostly theory-based learning, so the project is very basic across its functionality. The application allows users to create a baseball by entering a name, and then allows them to calculate and assign popular baseball statistics to that player.
